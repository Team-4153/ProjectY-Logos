# Introduction 
Hey there! 
This is Jason Pieck, 2022 Alumni of Team 4153 - Project Y!
In this repo, you will find all the files you need for your Project Y branding. Please read the information below to get started. If you have any questions, dont be afraid to reach out!

# Navigating the folders:
Folders are first broken down by color, then by type.

# Naming Conventions
File names are comprised of the following:
`ProjY_Text_Color_Background_Size`

| Parameter  | Options                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Text       | `0Text` (no text)        |
|            | `1Text` (no text)        |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Color      | `Default` (multicolored) |
|            | `Cyan`                   |
|            | `Navy`                   |
|            | `White`                  |
|            | `Black`                  |
| ---------- |------------------------- |
| Background | `Navy`                   |
|            | `Clear` (transparent)    |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Size       | `Small` (256x256 pxl)    |
|            | `Medium` (512x512 pxl)   |
|            | `Large` (1024x1024 pxl)  |
|            | `Huge` (2048x2048 pxl)   |

If you need larger, export directly from the .svg which all have a base resolution of 512x512.
If you would like to edit the logo, please use InkScape to edit the "2022 Project Y Logo 2022 Redesign File".
**Before you edit**, install the correct font (Fredoka One).

# Suggestions:
- Do not use the Cyan logos unless printing on a white surface. The defualt should always take precedence. 
- For profile pics on any platform, use the logo without text. (text is often too small to be legible)
- Use the largest possible image for your application when possible to avoid poor quality.
- For best quality, use the .svg in the sub folders
